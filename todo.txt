rewrite logging
    - Use ErrorLn, InfoLn, DebugLn.
    - Better explain logging levels, when each is used, etc. Same for ...Ln funcs.
    - Improve usage, use error where there are errors, info for more info, debug for everything else.

clean up db-specific files.
    - Since the older style New() and Default() funcs were removed.

Type() func?
    - returns config.Type.
    - Useful for switches?
    - "func Type() dbType" and "func (c *Config) Type() dbType".

Rewrite and reorganize translation and error ignoring funcs.
    - New files to organize these?
    - Better naming convention?
