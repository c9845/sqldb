v1.2.0
----------
- Allow choosing between mattn and modernc libraries for SQLite.
    - This helps with cross compiling since mattn required CGO while modernc does not.
    - Use build tags to choose which library to use at compile time.
    - mattn is default, for now, if build tag is omitted.

v1.1.1
----------
- Fix bug and improve checking if a connection has been closed.
    - Previously, just relied on checking if connection is nil which doesn't work if connection is closed. This only worked if connection was never established.
    - Alleviates issues with running UpdateSchema() right after DeploySchema().
- Renamed translation funcs to specify what database format they translate from and to.
- Remove unneeded logging.
